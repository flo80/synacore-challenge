# Synacore Challenge
Solutions to the [Synacore Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/)

Initially, I wanted to implement it in elm to have a nice web interface. But since I could not get it to work, I then re-implemented it in python. 

## Status
elm: 
- vm is largely implemented (fully functional program, fully typed) 
- in command is missing
- gets stuck on self test (most likely too slow, all commands should work)

pyhton:
- vm is fully implemented
- several debug commands implemented
- hack for teleport challenge included (see source)
- steps for solution included (several challenges I solved manually)
